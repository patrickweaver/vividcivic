INTRO 

####District Lines and Voting Rights
The Voting Rights Act of 1965, enacted in part due to Jim Crow-era voter disenfranchisement, prevents both election practices that intend to discriminate based on race, color, or protected minority language, and those that have [produce a discriminatory result](https://www.justice.gov/crt/redistricting-information). This includes the re-drawing of election districts by city and state entities. Enforced by the Civil Rights division of the United States Department of Justice, it was a key victory during the Civil Rights movement. Since its enactment, four additional languages have been added to the protected category, and the racial and ethnic gradations within the United States have greatly increased in plurality.

In more recent years, progressive and conservative groups alike have levied increasing criticism of the Act. Republicans in Congress have been extremely active about encouraging the Supreme Court to strike down Section 5 of the Act, which places the burden on the jurisdiction to demonstrate that its proposed plans do not have a [discriminatory effect](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/us/politics/supreme-court-redistricting-race.html?_r=1). However, Democrats and other liberal groups have also claimed that other parts of the act benefit Republicans by [reinforcing lines based on political affiliation rather than race](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/06/how-the-voting-rights-act-hurts-democrats-and-minorities/276893/). Nationally, black voters overwhelmingly support Democratic candidates, with a 90% correlation. 

####Contiguity
One of the major factors in VRA criteria involves the “packing” or “cracking” of communities, based on a contiguity analysis. In this case, communities that are part of a contiguous (neighboring) group of high percentage of residents may be added to another group where they are not as high of the district percentage (cracked), in order to diminish political representation, or added to a contiguous group of high percentage residents (packed) in order to preserve political representation in one district while diminishing their influence in another.

Population, Geography and Extent: Council Resources and Queens Demographics
Preliminary data about Asian Americans in Queens and how their communities were impacted by the 2014 New York City Council redistricting, provides an illustrative example of race and its effects on redistricting . As the most diverse county in the world, the borough of Queens provided an adequate extent to examine shifts in Council demographics. New York City saw a 32% increase in Asian residents between the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census, providing an ample amount of residential change within a ten-year period that corresponds with the ten-year period between each Council redistricting. 

Finally, I focus on City Council districts and discretionary public funds that are provided to Council Members to distribute to area organizations. Each Council Member receives between $650,000-780,000 annually for activities that may or may not be included in the annual fiscal budget. Concentrations of certain residents within Council districts may form non-profit organizations or provide support for organizations advocating for certain types of services in their communities. 

Advocacy groups contend that Asian residents in New York City do not receive public funding relative to the proportion of the population that their communities comprise. The 13% Coalition seeks to obtain public funding for services that is in proportion to the number of Asian residents within the City, rather than the reported 1% they currently estimate.

###Methodology
For the findings in this publication, I used 2000 and 2010 United States Census data to determine the distribution of Census racial demographics within Census block groups, the smallest Census geographic unit for which racial demographic data is collected. 

By overlaying the 2004 and 2014 City Council district lines, I was able to produce a number of findings based on spatial data. These include:
The concentration of Asian residents within the 2004 Council districts
The changes to these districts within the new 2014 Council lines
The areas of interest based on contiguity: districts where Asian residents saw the most increase, versus districts that saw a loss of Asian residents
Comparison of concentration of Asian residents versus white residents, especially where the district status quo population was maintained, as well as geographic concentration of emergent populations, and whether they were geographically near proposed and established district lines. Within the study area, two districts of high plurality where we compare residents brought into the district, versus residents districted out

####Overall
This study uses 2000 U.S. Census data with 2004 New York City Council district lines, and 2010 Census data with 2014 districts, to establish spatial distribution of racial demographics.

####Contiguity: Study Area
I created an initial study area of districts that saw the highest increase in Asian residents between 2004 and 2014 where they were contiguous to districts that either saw a decrease in Asian residents or no significant change.

####District Analysis
I isolated districts that had a high increase of Asian residents but were contiguous to areas that did not see a high increase. The demographics of these redistricted land tracts were examined to see if Asian residents were affected by redistricting at a higher rate than their overall make-up of the Council district.


###Findings

Like in the rest of New York City, Queens saw a dramatic increase of Asian residents between 2000 and 2010. This is demonstrated by the percentage of Asian residents that comprise the overall Council District population between 2004 and 2014.

Of Queens Council Districts, four saw the highest increase in Asian residents: Council Districts 20, 23, 24, and 25. In contrast, Council Districts 21 and 34 saw overall decreases in Asian residents.

####Contiguity: Study Area
We then compared the concentration of Asian residents to another group, white residents, in order to gain a more accurate picture of another majority community’s concentration within each district. Due to the location of growth within the borough, areas that were near 2004 and 2014 District lines tended to have high densities of Asian residents.

Many areas throughout the borough that changed districts contained high densities of Asian residents bordered areas where there was little change or decrease in Asian residents. This was especially true of Council Districts 23 and 25. 

In contrast, areas with high concentration of white residents were inconclusive. Though areas where Council Districts were changed also contained concentrations of white residents, many of the larger densities of white residents were preserved by 2014 District lines.

####District Analysis
We then examined two districts where increase in Asian residents ranked in the top four as a share of the population. These two districts contained small land tracts that were redistricted in and out: Council District 23 and 25.

###Council District 23 

In Council District 23, 46.4% of the people removed from the District were Asian residents. Of those added to the District, 48.8% were Asian. Overall, a similar amount of Asian residents were added and removed from the district, as were the amount of white non-Hispanic residents.

###Council District 25

In Council District 25, the highest number of residents removed from the District were Hispanic, at 70.9%. Of those added to the District, 65.1% were Asian. Overall, a disproportionate amount of Hispanic residents were removed from CD 25, while a disproportionate amount of Asian residents were added.

###Conclusion
Asian residents in Queens increased significantly between the 2000 and 2010 U.S. Census, and this growth is reflected in the percentage gains of Council Districts 20, 23, 24, and 25. In this preliminary study, significant impact on Asian residents as a result of the 2014 New York City Council redistricting were inconclusive. However, several observations from this study may provide insight for further research. They include:

In districts where Asian growth was the highest in the borough, redistricted areas tended to contain a higher percentage of Asian residents than comprised the overall district. 

Redistricted areas tend to be contiguous to areas of high increase in Asian residents: areas of emergent Asian growth that were contiguous to large blocs of Asian residents, tended to be added or removed to various districts, especially where overall racial distributions were preserved from 2004 to 2014.

Lack of impact on Asian growth on Council District 21: Council districts that border CD 21 both experienced a significant increase in Asian residents in 2014, but did not itself experience any significant increase. Asian residents comprised a high percentage of those that were added to its bordering district, CD 25, disproportionate to the percentage of Asians who reside in the district. In contrast, Hispanic residents comprise 70.9% of those removed from CD 25, also disproportionate to the percentage that reside in the district. 

Redistricted Council Lines in CD23: a corridor with a high concentration of Asian residents that run along the border between CD23 and CD19 was redistricted to exchange the same amount of Asian and white residents in mirroring parcels.

I recommend additional inquiry into the areas that were added or removed from Council Dmeistricts in 2014:
Comparison of Asian density to other minorities in Queens
Disaggregation of Asian densities to account for East Asian (Chinese, Korean) and South Asian (Indian, Pakistani) groups

###Assumptions
This study makes several assumptions in its research approach and results. It assumes that race is a potential indicator for bias in local elections because it has such a high correlation of political decision-making in both state and national elections.

It also assumes that Asian communities are monolithic, as it refers to aggregated data for each U.S. census block group. Since the Asian community in New York City is comprised of multiple subgroups, this study does not account for divisions within assumed geographic concentrations, or “blocs,” of Asian residents. 

In addition, U.S. Census block groups are not entirely contiguous with New York City Council District lines in 2004 or 2010. This study accounts for those block groups that are included within, or mostly within, certain districts.
